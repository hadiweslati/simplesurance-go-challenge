This is my solution on the test you assigned to me. 
The code contains: 
- main.go file: the entry point of the application.
- counter package: for the Counter model.
- stress-test folder: contains a test case of 5 simultaneous calls to the endpoint.

This task took me between 2-3 hours.\
I want to deliver the best solution, I began with:\
1. An in-memory persist solution: It was very straight forward.
2. I tried to enhance that by adding a simplified version of a semaphore.
3. Although I thought about implementing a FIFO queue, but It's almost the same as what I implemented with more code (adding enqueue & dequeue methods).


I hope you find my suggested solution to be satisfactory.\
Eagerly awaiting your feedback.
Thank you!
